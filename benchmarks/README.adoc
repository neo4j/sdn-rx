= Benchmarks
:sectanchors:

== Prerequisites

All benchmarks require Java 12.

=== SDN/RX

As long as SDN/RX itself is not yet on central, you have to build a snapshot your self.
Please do this on the top level of SDN/RX with

```
./mvnw -DskipTests -Drevision=999 -Dchangelist=-BENCHMARK clean install
```

=== Neo4j

You either need a running database somewhere or a working Docker installation on your machine.

== Run

Each benchmark can be build with

```
mvn clean package
```

and run with

```
java -jar target/benchmark.jar
```

In this case, the benchmarks will fire up a https://www.testcontainers.org[Testcontainer] with Neo4j and the result is probably lower.

To use a locally running instance, start each test like:

```
SDN_RX_NEO4J_URL=bolt://localhost:7687 SDN_RX_NEO4J_PASSWORD=benchmark java -jar target/benchmark.jar
```

=== Results

==== MacBook Pro 13", 3,5GHz i7, 16 GB, macOS 10.14.5

Neo4j 3.5.7 Enterprise Edition, default configuration with memory settings below:

```
dbms.memory.heap.initial_size=2G
dbms.memory.heap.max_size=2G
```

The database has been stopped and restarted after each module.
