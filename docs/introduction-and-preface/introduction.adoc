== Your way through this document

If you already familiar with the core concepts of Spring Data, head straight to <<getting-started>>.
This chapter will walk you through different options of configuring an application to connect to a Neo4j instance and how to model your domain.

In most cases, you will need a domain.
Go to <<mapping>> to learn about how to map nodes and relationships to your domain model.

After that, you will need some means to query the domain.
Choices are  <<neo4j-repositories, Neo4j repositories>>, <<neo4j-template, the Neo4j Template>> or on a lower level, <<neo4j-client, the Neo4j Client>>.
All of them are available in a <<reactive-programming,reactive fashion>> as well.
Apart from the paging mechanism, all the features of standard repositories are available in the reactive variant.

You will find the building blocks in the next <<building-blocks,chapter>>.

To learn more about the general concepts of repositories, head over to <<repositories>>.

You can of course read on, continuing with the preface and a gentle getting started guide.
