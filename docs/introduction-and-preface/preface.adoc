== NoSQL and Graph databases

A graph database is a storage engine that is specialized in storing and retrieving vast networks of information.
It efficiently stores data as nodes with relationships to other or even the same nodes,
thus allowing high-performance retrieval and querying of those structures.
Properties can be added to both nodes and relationships.
Nodes can be labelled by zero or more labels, relationships are always directed and named.

Graph databases are well suited for storing most kinds of domain models.
In almost all domains, there are certain things connected to other things.
In most other modeling approaches, the relationships between things are reduced to a single link without identity and attributes.
Graph databases allow to keep the rich relationships that originate from the domain equally well-represented in the database without resorting to also modeling the relationships as "things".
There is very little "impedance mismatch" when putting real-life domains into a graph database.


[[preface.nosql.neo4j]]
=== Introducing Neo4j

https://neo4j.com/[Neo4j] is an open source NoSQL graph database.
It is a fully transactional database (ACID) that stores data structured as graphs consisting of nodes, connected by relationships.
Inspired by the structure of the real world, it allows for high query performance on complex data, while remaining intuitive and simple for the developer.

The starting point for learning about Neo4j is https://neo4j.com/[neo4j.com].
Here is a list of useful resources:

* The https://neo4j.com/docs/[Neo4j documentation] introduces Neo4j and contains links to getting started guides, reference documentation and tutorials.
* The https://neo4j.com/sandbox/[online sandbox] provides a convenient way to interact with a Neo4j instance in combination with the online https://neo4j.com/developer/get-started/[tutorial].
* Neo4j https://neo4j.com/developer/java/[Java Bolt Driver]

[[preface.spring-data]]
== Spring and Spring Data

Spring Data uses Spring Framework's https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/core.html[core] functionality,
such as the https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans[IoC] container,
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/core.html#core-convert[type conversion system],
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/core.html#expressions[expression language],
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#jmx[JMX integration],
and portable https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{springVersion}/spring-framework-reference/data-access.html#dao-exceptions[DAO exception hierarchy].
While it is not necessary to know all the Spring APIs, understanding the concepts behind them is.
At a minimum, the idea behind IoC should be familiar.

The Spring Data Neo4j project applies Spring Data concepts to the development of solutions using the Neo4j graph data store.
We provide _repositories_ as a high-level abstraction for storing and querying documents as well as templates and clients for generic domain access or generic query execution.
All of them are integrated with Spring's application transactions.

The core functionality of the Neo4j support can be used directly, through either the `Neo4jClient` or the `Neo4jTemplate` or the reactive variants thereof.
All of them provide integration with Spring's application level transactions.
On a lower level, you can grab the Bolt driver instance, but than you have to manage your own transactions.

To learn more about Spring, you can refer to the comprehensive documentation that explains in detail the Spring Framework.
There are a lot of articles, blog entries and books on the matter - take a look at the Spring Framework https://spring.io/docs[home page ] for more information.

[[what-is-sdn-rx]]
== What is Spring Data Neo4j⚡️RX

Spring Data Neo4j⚡RX is the successor to Spring Data Neo4j + Neo4j-OGM.
The separate layer of Neo4j-OGM (Neo4j Object Graph Mapper) has been replaced by Spring infrastructure, but the basic concepts of an Object Graph Mapper (OGM) still apply:

An OGM maps nodes and relationships in the graph to objects and references in a domain model.
Object instances are mapped to nodes while object references are mapped using relationships, or serialized to properties (e.g. references to a Date).
JVM primitives are mapped to node or relationship properties.
An OGM abstracts the database and provides a convenient way to persist your domain model in the graph and query it without having to use low level drivers directly.
It also provides the flexibility to the developer to supply custom queries where the queries generated by SDN/RX are insufficient.

=== What's in the box?

Spring Data Neo4j⚡RX or in short SDN/RX is a next-generation https://spring.io/projects/spring-data[Spring Data] module,
created and maintained by https://neo4j.com[Neo4j, Inc.] in close collaboration with https://pivotal.io[Pivotal's] Spring Data Team.

SDN/RX relies completely on the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver[Neo4j Java Driver],
without introducing another "driver" or "transport" layer between the mapping framework and the driver.
The Neo4j Java Driver - sometimes dubbed Bolt or the Bolt driver - is used as a protocol much like JDBC is with relational databases.

Noteworthy features that differentiate SDN/RX from Spring Data Neo4j + OGM are

* Full support for immutable entities and thus full support for Kotlin's data classes
* Full support for the reactive programming model in the Spring Framework itself and Spring Data
* Brand new Neo4j client and reactive client feature, resurrecting the idea of a template over the plain driver, easing database access

SDN/RX is currently developed with https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-neo4j[Spring Data Neo4j] in parallel and will replace it eventually when they are on feature parity in regards of repository support and mapping.


=== Why should I use SDN/RX in favor of SDN+OGM

SDN/RX has several features not present in SDN+OGM, notably

* Full support for Springs reactive story, including reactive transaction
* Full support for https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#query-by-example[Query By Example]
* Full support for fully immutable entities
* Support for all modifiers and variations of derived finder methods, including spatial queries

=== Do I need both SDN/RX and Spring Data Neo4j?

No.

They are mutually exclusive and you cannot mix them in one project.

=== How does SDN/RX relate to Neo4j-OGM?

https://neo4j.com/docs/ogm-manual/current/[Neo4j-OGM] is an Object Graph Mapping library, which is mainly used by Spring Data Neo4j as its backend for the heavy lifting of mapping nodes and relationships into domain object.
SDN/RX *does not need* and *does not support* Neo4j-OGM.
SDN/RX uses Spring Data's mapping context exclusively for scanning classes and building the meta model.

While this pins SDN/RX to the Spring eco systems, it has several advantages, among them the smaller footprint in regards of CPU and memory usage and especially, all the features of Springs mapping context.

=== Does SDN/RX support connections over HTTP to Neo4j?

No.

=== Does SDN/RX support embedded Neo4j?

Embedded Neo4j has multiple facets to it:

==== Does SDN/RX provide an embedded instance for your application?

No.

==== Does SDN/RX interact directly with an embedded instance?

No.
An embedded database is usually represented by an instance of `org.neo4j.graphdb.GraphDatabaseService` and has no Bolt connector out of the box.

SDN/RX can however work very much with Neo4j's test harness, the test harness is specially meant to be a drop-in replacement for the real database.
Support for both Neo4j 3.5 and 4.0 test harness is implemented via link:{java-driver-starter-href}[the Spring Boot starter for the driver].
Have a look at the corresponding module `org.neo4j.driver:neo4j-java-driver-test-harness-spring-boot-autoconfigure`.

==== Can I use SDN/RX without Spring Boot?

Yes, see our `README`.
We provide `org.neo4j.springframework.data.config.AbstractNeo4jConfig` and `org.neo4j.springframework.data.config.AbstractReactiveNeo4jConfig` for that purpose.
