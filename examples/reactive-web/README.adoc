== Spring Boot / Reactive Web Example

=== Building SDN/RX and Examples.

NOTE: You need to have JDK 11 installed.

You can either built the complete project, including the examples.
Thus, the examples will use your copy of SDN/RX, and any potential changes you made:

[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:neo4j/sdn-rx
cd sdn-rx
./mvnw -DskipTests -Drevision=1.0.0 -Dchangelist=-SNAPSHOT clean package
----

If you want to only try out the examples with the currently released version,
pick out the example you like (for example the `reactive-web` example) and build it like this:

[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:neo4j/sdn-rx
cd sdn-rx/examples/reactive-web
mvn -DskipTests clean package
cd ../..
----

=== Running the examples.

You'll need a Neo4j 4 instance that supports reactive database access and has a user name `neo4j` with a password of `secret`.
Please use `:play movies` in Neo4j browser to get some data in your graph.
With from SDN/RX root folder run

[source,bash]
----
java -jar examples/reactive-web/target/movie-api.jar
----

If your database has different credentials or is on a different host, run

[source,bash]
----
java -jar examples/reactive-web/target/movie-api.jar \
--org.neo4j.driver.uri=neo4j://yourhost:7687 \
--org.neo4j.driver.authentication.username=youruser \
--org.neo4j.driver.authentication.password=yourpassword
----

with parameters fitting to your needs.

Here are some _curl_ commands, you can try out.
The same examples are also available in the file `movie-api-examples.http` that you can call from IDEA.

[source,bash]
.Create a new movie
----
curl -X "PUT" "http://localhost:8080/movies" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
  "title": "Aeon Flux",
  "description": "Reactive is the new cool"
}'
----

[source,bash]
.List all movies.
----
curl http://localhost:8080/movies
----

[source,bash]
.Query a movie by title.
----
curl http://localhost:8080/movies/by-title\?title\=Aeon%20Flux
----

[source,bash]
.Delete a movie by id (use the one returned above for example)
----
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/movies/847
----

=== Experimental support for Visual Studio Remote Containers

To make playing with the examples a bit easier, we have support for https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview[VS Code Remote Development].
Please follow the instructions at the link above for setting up your Visual Studio Code environment.

Open `reactive-web` in Visual Studio Code and let it build the container.
The container will for now contain a locally build snapshot of SDN/RX that serves as dependencies for the example.
The example than can be build and run via Visual Studios support for Spring Boot, which is automatically added to the development container.

The running example can be accessed from the outside as shown above without any further actions.

At the moment, a locally running Neo4j 4.0 instance is still required, as there is no officially available image yet.
